# DEPENDENCY TRACKING

# The purpose of this section is help Make understand when to re-run a target and when it's not needed. Make uses file
# timestamps to determine if targets are up to date. By providing a list of files that a target depends on, Make can
# evaluate all inputs and compare them with the expected output and either re-run or skip the target.
